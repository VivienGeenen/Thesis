@proceedings{Garulli.1999,
 abstract = {This book comprises a selection of papers that were first presented at the Robustness in Identification and Control Workshop, held in Siena, July 30 - August 2, 1998. These are the latest contributions to the field, from leading researchers worldwide. The common theme underlying all of the contributions is the interplay between information, uncertainty and complexity in dealing with modelling, identification and control of dynamical systems. Papers cover recent developments in research areas such as identification for control and the classical area of robust control. There are a number of real-world case studies where the most advanced robustness analysis and synthesis techniques are applied to resolve previously unsolved problems. The relevance of the topic to the system engineering field, and the excellent scientific level of the contributions combine to make this book an important acquisition for engineers, control theorists and applied mathematicians},

@article{Hazyuk.2012b,
 abstract = {The goal of optimal temperature control in buildings is usually to ensure thermal comfort with minimal energy consumption. In intermittently occupied buildings, this presumes the ability of the controller to recover in due time the building from setback. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is considered among the best candidates for this task due to its ability to use occupancy schedule and weather forecasts for optimal temperature control. However, the use of the classical cost function within MPC does not allow to achieve the objectives of minimal energy consumption and optimal restart of the heating system. Therefore, a new cost function is introduced, which minimizes the energy consumption while maintaining the thermal comfort in the building. The obtained linear optimization problem is formulated to fit into the canonical form of Linear Programming method.},

Current and Future Directions



Readers of this book will be shown how, with the adoption of ubiquituous sensing, extensive data-gathering and forecasting, and building-embedded advanced actuation, intelligent building systems with the ability to respond to occupant preferences in a safe and energy-efficient manner are becoming a reality. The articles collected present a holistic perspective on the state of the art and current research directions in building automation, advanced sensing and control, including: model-based and model-free control design for temperature control; smart lighting systems; smart sensors and actuators (such as smart thermostats, lighting fixtures and HVAC equipment with embedded intelligence); and energy management, including consideration of grid connectivity and distributed intelligence. These articles are both educational for practitioners and graduate students interested in design and implementation, and foundational for researchers interested in understanding the state of the art and the challenges that must be overcome in realizing the potential benefits of smart building systems. This edited volume also includes case studies from implementation of these algorithms/sensing strategies in to-scale building systems. These demonstrate the benefits and pitfalls of using smart sensing and control for enhanced occupant comfort and energy efficiency},

@article{Kramer.2012,
 abstract = {This paper provides a systematic literature review on simplified building models. Questions are answered like: What kind of modelling approaches are applied? What are their (dis)advantages? What are important modelling aspects? The review showed that simplified building models can be classified into neural network models (black box), linear parametric models (black box or grey box) and lumped capacitance models (white box). Research has mainly dealt with network topology, but more research is needed on the influence of input parameters. The review showed that particularly the modelling of the influence of sun irradiation and thermal capacitance is not performed consistently amongst researchers. Furthermore, a model with physical meaning, dealing with both temperature and relative humidity, is still lacking. Inverse modelling has been widely applied to determine models parameters. Different optimization algorithms have been used, but mainly the conventional Gaus--Newton and the newer genetic algorithms. However, the combination of algorithms to combine their strengths has not been researched. Despite all the attention for state of the art building performance simulation tools, simplified building models should not be forgotten since they have many useful applications. Further research is needed to develop a simplified hygric and thermal building model with physical meaning.},
