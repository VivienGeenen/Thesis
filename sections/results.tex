\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}
In this chapter, different scenarios are considered to answer the research question. Several scenarios are supposed to explain how the occupancy schedule affects energy consumption, grid service and comfort: (i) a scenario with an occupancy schedule, in which the MPC has to comply with fewer restrictions during the absence of occupants; (ii) a scenario that also has a lower temperature specification during the absence; and (iii) a scenario without an occupancy schedule. In the last section, the results are evaluated, and an answer to the research question is found.
