\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Increasing fluctuations due to more renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics or wind power, make balancing the grid more difficult. More energy storage options and demand side management can remedy the situation. In this thesis, an MPC of the HVAC system of a building uses the thermal storage of the building and consumes energy with the heat pump in a favourable time for the grid. Moreover, the influence of an occupancy schedule is investigated on grid services.\newline
At first, a thermal model is generated, which predicts the future behaviour of the building's average inside temperature in the MPC. The complete model is separated into the submodels water reservoir and building model. The water reservoir is modelled with the white-box approach, while the building model is created as a grey-box model. For the last mentioned submodel, we identify the parameters, such as thermal resistances and capacitances, with data from the reference building and verify the building model with a verification data set. The data is generated with experiments. Therefore, electrical heaters are positioned in the reference building and heat the building. The data acquisition occurs via temperature sensors and sensors for recording the power consumption, which are permanently installed in the building. The collected data is used for training and verification of the building model. \newline
In the MPC, the control signals from the heat pump and heating are optimised to regulate the indoor temperature over the predictive horizon with respect to the cost function. There, we consider constraints, which limit the control signal, pretend a temperature range or restrict states. To simulate the MPC, we use data from the reference building, which represent the weather forecasts. An occupancy schedule specifies the MPC the time when the comfort requirement is required. The dynamic price of electricity is used as an indicator for the favourable time to supply power from the grid. Furthermore, the length of the predictive horizon is determined as 24 h.\newline
At last, scenarios are investigated concerning comfort, grid service and energy consumption. The basic scenario includes the occupancy schedule and expects 22째C inside temperature during the presence of occupants. Scenario 2 respects the occupancy schedule and changes the desired temperature between 17째C and 22째C during the absence and presence of occupants. While scenario 3 always desires the inside temperature at 22째C. The basic scenario is best suited to combine comfort, energy consumption and grid services.\newline
